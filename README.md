# Reconfigurable Hinged Kirigami Tessellations
This is an example code for our paper "Reconfigurable Hinged Kirigami Tessellations", *SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 (conference track)*, by [Aviv Segall*](https://igl.ethz.ch/people/), [Jing Ren*](https://ren-jing.com/), [Marcel Padilla](https://marcelpadilla.com/) and [Olga Sorkine-Hornung](https://igl.ethz.ch/people/sorkine).


In this project, we introduce a computational method for **designing kirigami patterns that reconfigure flat sheets into complex shapes**. By analyzing planar tilings and their rotational deployment, we identify valid cuts and generate novel, physically realizable structures. This enables inverse design of expressive, gap-free geometries through combinatorial reconfiguration.
